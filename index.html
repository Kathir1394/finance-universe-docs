        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 1, 2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for using <strong>Finance Universe</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains
            how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal financial data on our servers.</strong></p>
        <p>Finance Universe is designed as a local-first application. All data you enter into the app (including
            transaction details, budget information, and account balances) is stored locally on your device using an
            internal database. We do not have access to this data.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Export and Import</h2>
        <p>Finance Universe provides functionality to export your financial data to Excel files and import data from
            them. This feature is designed to give you full control over your data. The exported files are generated
            locally on your device. When you choose to share or save these files, they are handled by your device's
            standard sharing mechanisms. We do not intercept or upload these files to any external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Receipt Scanning</h2>
        <p>The application includes a receipt scanning feature that uses on-device machine learning (Google ML Kit) to
            extract information from images you select. This processing happens entirely on your device. The images you
            scan are not uploaded to the cloud or shared with third parties.</p>

        <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The application requests only the minimum permissions necessary for its core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage/Photos:</strong> Required only if you choose to save exported files to your device or
                select receipt images for scanning.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required only if you choose to take a photo of a receipt for scanning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not request access to sensitive data such as your contacts, SMS messages, call logs, or precise
            location.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The application may use third-party libraries for standard functionality (e.g., UI components, local
            notifications). These services are used strictly for technical purposes and do not collect personal
            information for tracking or advertising.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device, its security relies on your device's security measures. We
            recommend keeping your device secure with a passcode or biometric lock.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
